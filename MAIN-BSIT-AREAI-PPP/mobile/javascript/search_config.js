The level of awareness                               and acceptance of the respondents to VMGO was “Exceptionally”.                             •  VMGO are mostly disseminated through the class orientation, Student Handbook,                               website or portal of the university, tarpaulins / posters displayed especially in the key                                areas of the university, indoor/outdoor LED wall and the least on College/University                               programs.  Other  suggested  methods  of  disseminating  the  VMGO  are  through                                PowerPoint presentation / audio visual presentation (AVP), conferences / exhibits,                               and the use of the e-mail and social media.                             •  Use of other forms of media and the translation of the VMGO to the local dialect was                                considered.                  ➢  Describe the implementation of the VMGO and their congruence with educational practices                    and activities;                         Most of the universities and colleges were established by virtue of the national legislation.                  Its mandate is to serve it service area through the provision of quality and affordable education. Aside                 from instruction, these learning institutions are mandated to perform research and extension as well                  as production.                          To meet the above functions, every learning institution has to establish its own Vision and                  Mission that is in harmony with  the national, regional, provincial and local development goals,                 thrusts, policies and directions.                           The College of Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT) similarly has to establish                 its goals in support with the University Vision and Mission with these in mind, all activities, plans                  and development directions are conducted and implemented, and prepared toward the achievement                 of these guiding principles:                       •  National Economic and Development Plan (NEDA)                   Information Technology Education | Area I: The Vision Mission, Goals and Objectives                                                                                                              25","Bachelor of Science in Information Technology                      •  RA 8468: CvSU’s Legal and Educational Mandate                    •  Cavite State University (CvSU) Manual of Operations                                                                                                  Information Technology Education | Area I: The Vision Mission, Goals and Objectives                                                                                                              26","Bachelor of Science in Information Technology                                                                                                      Information Technology Education | Area I: The Vision Mission, Goals and Objectives                                                                                                              27","Bachelor of Science in Information Technology                          Guided by the University Vision and Mission and Goals of the College, the objectives of the                 curricular programs (in terms of outcomes) were also prepared.
