Several transformations                  in the name of the school took place; Indang Farm School in 1918, Indang Rural High School in                 1927, and Don Severino National Agriculture School in 1958. In 1964, the school was converted                 into  a  State  College  by  virtue  of  Republic  Act  3917  and  became  known  as  Don  Severino                 Agricultural College (DSAC). On January 22, 1998, by virtue of Republic Act No.8468, DSAC was                 converted into Cavite State University.                          The College of Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT) started as the Department                 of Agricultural Engineering inv1976. It offered basic agricultural engineering courses required by                 the BSA curriculum. In 1985, the unit was renamed to Department of Engineering and Agro-                 Industrial Technology (DEAIT). By virtue of Board Resolution No. 5, S1985, it started to offer                 Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering on the first semester of SY 1985 – 1986.                         In 1992, the department was elevated to the School status. This resulted in the creation                 of  two  (2)  distinct  departments:  the  Engineering  Science  Department  and  the  Agricultural                  Engineering Department. The formation of these departments delineated the basic engineering                 science  courses  from  the  agricultural  engineering  courses.  In  1993,  the  Department  of                 Engineering Technology was created. The newly created department offers non-degree courses                 in engineering technology.                         In 1998, when the College was elevated to University status, the School of Engineering                  (SEng)  was  subsequently  elevated  to  the  College  level  and  was  named  as  the  College  of                 Engineering (CEng). To accommodate IT courses offerings; the College was renamed as the                 College of Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT) in 2001.","Bachelor of Science in Information Technology                                                                                             Level III Phase 2                         To address the changing needs of the clientele brought about by the modernization and                 industrialization  in  the  CALABARZON  (Cavite  Batangas,  Laguna,  Rizal,  Quezon)  area,  the                  College of Engineering offered BS in Information Technology in 2001.                         The  BSIT  program  includes  the  study  of  both  hardware  and  software  technologies                 involving  planning,  installing,  customizing,  operating,  managing  and  administering,  and                 maintaining information technology infrastructure that provides computing solutions to address                 the needs of an organization. The program also prepares the graduates to address various user                  needs  involving  the  selection,  development,  application,  integration  and  management  of                 computing technologies within an organization.","Bachelor of Science in Information Technology                                                                                             Level III Phase 2                     1.

Report                                 Assignments. Assignments are given to the class to enhance the knowledge of                          students on topics being discussed in class.  It could also be a preparation of the next                         topic which will discussed on the next meeting.                                Brainstorming. Brainstorming is a group creativity by which efforts are made to                         find  a  conclusion  for  a  specific  problem  by  gathering  a  list  of  ideas  spontaneously                         contributed by its members.  This helps to get students unstuck by jolting them out of their                         normal ways of thinking.  Therefore, during brainstorming sessions, students should avoid                         criticizing or rewarding ideas.  Mind mapping is a great way to brainstorm, make a plan,                          or turn ideas into steps needed to make it real.                                Field Trips/Visits. In most cases, exposure to real life situations are important                         learning methodologies where concepts are applied in site.  Field visits help students                         acquire  methodologies  and  technologies  relevant  to  their  field.    During  these  visits,                         students are given opportunity to observe how the principles are put into practice.  This                          enhances the students’ knowledge that they have learned in the classroom.                                Group Discussion/Interactive Learning. In this strategy, a topic is presented                         through presentation, after which the group assigned an issue to discuss, brainstorm and                         interact.    Through  the  internet,  members  of  the  group  may  conduct  a  more  thorough                         research about the topic to enhance their knowledge.  Moreover, a set of questions are                         given to each group to serve as guide for the discussion and presentation.  At the end of                         the session, in front of the whole class, each group presents answers to the questions","Bachelor of Science in Information Technology                                                                                             Level III Phase 2                          posted by the lecturer and their synthesis of the topic.  The lecturer then clarifies and                         stresses important points and summarizes the main features or arguments of the topics.                         Each group evaluates the presentation of the other groups using a class-evaluated rubric                         assessment.                                 Group  Discussion  with  Individual  Reflection.  When  students  continuously                         reflect on their experiences, students find their ideas gaining in complexity and power and                         they develop increasingly strong abilities to integrate new information.  Students in the                         class are grouped and are presented with a topic, and the guide questions are discussed                         by  the  members  of  the group.  The  leader  facilitates  the  discussion  while  the  reporter                          records the main points arrived by the members of the group.  Each student prepares                         his/her own reflection of the topics presented and submits it to the lecturer.  Then, a short                         presentation of the main points of the group is presented by the designated reporter.  The                         lecturer guides the reporters by extracting answers to the questions. The reflection papers                         are then graded using a class-evaluated rubric assessment.                                Reporting.  In  some  subjects,  students  are  given  the  responsibility  to  present                         specific  topics  in  the  class.    Students  are  rated  both  by  their  professors  and  also                          classmates.  Each student gives rating to the reporter based on the following criteria:                         content,  organization  (vocabulary,  use  of  complete  sentences,  comprehension),  and                         delivery (preparedness, use of props, time limit, posture and eye contact, speaks with                         clarity, enthusiasm).                                Laboratory  Exercises/Experiments.  Laboratory  exercises  are  parts  of  the                         requirements  for  passing  the  course.    This  includes  activities  or  experiments  which                          enhance the understanding and knowledge level of students on topics discussed in the                         lecture.  Students are exposed to hands-on activities which provide them the opportunity                         to go through the procedures and processes.  The laboratory serves as an active learning","Bachelor of Science in Information Technology                                                                                             Level III Phase 2                          environment for students where practical experiments may lead to good understanding of                         underlying theories and desired skills in the conduct of the experiments.                                Research Project. Research projects on topics of concern in a specific subject                         are conducted as requirements for a course.  This provides students with inputs in the                          discussion of concepts and enhance their skills in research activity which is a competency                         required of a graduate of engineering field.                                Inviting  Resource  Persons.  Resource  persons  are  not  only  invited  during                         seminars and workshops.  Professors also invite knowledgeable persons in the field to                         speak in classes that call for experts in certain areas.  This is usually conducted in subjects                          which require specific competency.                                Problem  Solving.  This  method  involves  solving  problems  using  technical                         scientific mathematical and analytical procedures.                                Seminar/Workshop. This method involves application and integration of certain                         competencies expected from a BSIT graduate.                      3.5.
