               FACULTY DEVELOPMENT

               Introduction


                       A  faculty  member  is  an  academic  employee  who  performs  instruction,  research  and


               extension functions. In the field of information technology (IT), an IT faculty member specializes

               in the development, maintenance, and use of computer systems, software, and networks for the

               processing and distribution of data. A process by which faculty members work in a systematic

               way to improve their skills in the areas like: educational skills; leadership skills; skills necessary

               to  engage  in  scholarly  activities,  and  personal  development;  and  skills  in  designing  and

               implementing a professional development plan is what faculty development focuses. It consists

               of a broad-range of activities designed to improve teaching effectiveness and efficiency which


               ultimately  helps  in  the  attainment  of  the  University’s  vision,  mission  and  the  tenets  –  truth,

               excellence, and service.

                       1.2 Performance Management System

                              The University recognizes the value of its faculty members as the key resources


                       that must be continuously enhanced to sustain outstanding work performances. To be

                       able to increase the levels of productivity and uphold the highest standards of the faculty

                       members’  performance,  the Strategic Performance Management  System  (SPMS)  was

                       established by the University to be able to encourage the improvement of the efficiency of

                       the human resource and the organization.

                              The SPMS focuses on linking each faculty members and employees to the vision,

                       mission and goals of the University. Furthermore, it is a tool used to ensure if the functions


                       of  the  various  colleges/campuses  and  units  together  with  its  constituents  are  fulfilled

                       according to the standards set by the institution.

                          The basic elements of SPMS are the following:

                          a.  Goals are aligned to the University Mandate and Organizational Priorities.

                              Performance goals and measurements will be aligned to the national development

                              plans,  University  mandate/vision/mission  and  strategic  priorities  and


                              organizational performance indicator framework. Standards will be predetermined

                              to ensure efficient use and management of inputs and work processes.

                          b.  Outputs/Outcomes-Based. The system puts premium in major final outputs that

                              will  contribute  to  the  realization  of  the  University  mandate,  vision,  strategic

                              priorities, outputs and outcomes.

                              roles in the achievement of organizational goals are clearly defined to give way to

                              collective goal setting and performance rating.

                          d.  User  friendly.  The  forms  used  for  both  the  organizational  and  individual

                              performance are similar and easy to accomplish.


                          e.  Communication Plan. A program to orient officials and employees on the new

                              and revised policies on SPMS shall be implemented to promote awareness and

                              support of the program.



                              Vice Presidents, deans and directors meet department heads and employees and

                       must agree on outputs to be accomplished. For the Office Performance Target for MFO

                       1, MFO 2, and MFO 3, the performance measures and success indicators per category is

                       utilized in the Office performance Commitment and Review (OPCR) form. For Individual

                       Office Performance Commitment using the IPCR for faculty members, the predetermined

                       measures and indicators per faculty category is used in the target setting to measure the


                       quality of outputs. The QCE forms of NBC 461 is also used, For Performance Commitment

                       Target for MFO No. 4, performance measures and success indicators are based on the

                       approved University PMS-OPES. It shall also be the basis for individual target setting of

                       non-academic employees. All performances are measured on three categories as shown

                       in Table 2.]]></page><page Index="34"><![CDATA[Bachelor of Science in Information Technology

                       1.3 Rewards and Incentive System

                              Employees  who  rendered  valuable  contributions  to  the  University  are  given

                       recognition of one’s service, effort or achievement especially faculty members achieving

                       work goals or doing the job well. When an incentive is given for the achievement, a faculty

                       morale  is  increased  and  provides  inspiration  for  others  to  excel.  Rewarding  incentive

                       increases productivity and loyalty among the forces of the academe and at the same time

                       increases the status of the University in the academic sector.

                       exemplary  service  and  commendable  conduct  such  as  clearly  stipulated  in  the  CvSU

                       Manual of Operations. In granting awards and incentives to faculty, the award selection

                       committee considers the following: the years of service and the quality and consistency of

                       performance,  the  obscurity  of  the  positions,  the  salary  level,  the  uniqueness  and


                       exemplary quality of a certain achievement, and the risks and temptations inherent in the

                       work. Rewards and incentives are awarded in either monetary and non-monetary forms

                       to  faculty  members  who  demonstrated  exemplary  or  commendable  performances  as

                       stated in the CvSU Manual of Operations, Rule XIII, Section 13, pages 129-130.]]></page><page Index="86"><![CDATA[Bachelor of Science in Information Technology

                              1.3.1 The Unified Workload System

                                     Based on the CMO No. 46, Series of 2012, the University implements a

                              Unified  Workload  System  that  adheres  to  promote  the  core  functions  of  the

                              University namely: Instruction, Research, Extension and Production. Prior to the

                              Unified Workload System, the University has been providing incentives to faculty

                              members who are tasked to perform lateral assignments on top of their regular 18

                              teaching units. Using the Unified Workload System, the contribution of the faculty


                              to research and extension are now included in the criteria. The individual workload

                              performance  is  evaluated  based  on  the  academic  rank  and/or  designation,

                              teaching effectiveness, research performance/output and extension outcomes.

                                     The  Unified  Workload  System  is  intended  to  achieve  the  following

                              objectives:


                                     1.  to reconcile Individual Performance Commitment and Review (IPCR)

                                         of the faculty member and workload system;

                                     2.  to help the University in delivering effective instruction and improving

                                         the research and extension output;

                                     3.  to  provide  additional  compensation  to  faculty  members  with  extra

                                         teaching loads, research and extension loads, and lateral assignments;

                                         and


                                     4.  to motivate faculty members in the performance of their assigned tasks.

                       (SET)”  every  semester.  The  SET  is  done  to  indicate  the  teacher’s  performance  in

                       instruction rated by the students. Thus, it also indicates how satisfactory or excellent the

                       teacher to the students. Likewise, SET also establishes as the basis for the instructors’

                       rank for rehiring.

                              Aside  from  the  evaluation  rated  by  the  students,  the  department  chair  also


                       conducts class observation/visitation. The said evaluation was a systematic classroom

                       evaluation measuring the instructor’s way of teaching and behavior inside the classroom

                       observed by the department chair. Furthermore, it also includes the student-instructor

                       interaction  and  the  learning  environment.  This  classroom  evaluation  describes

                       instructional  practices  of  the  instructors  and  suggests  improvement  on  classroom


                       instruction and management based on feedback from the students and peer instructors.

                       Extension activities are also one of the major functions of the faculty bringing education

               into  the  immediate  community.  Verified  technologies  are  transferred  to  the  residents  of  the

               Barangays  with  the  objective  of  improving  the  community’s  quality  of  living.  Participation  to

               community celebrations and projects also strengths the linkage between the University and the

               community.
