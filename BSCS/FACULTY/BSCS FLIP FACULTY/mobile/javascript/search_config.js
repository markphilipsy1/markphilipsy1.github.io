The SET is done to indicate the teacher’s                                performance in instruction rated by the students. Thus, it also indicates how                                satisfactory or excellent the teacher to the students. Likewise, SET also sets as                                 the basis for the instructors’ rank for rehiring.                                       Aside from the evaluation rated by the students, the department chair                                also conducts class observation/visitation. The said evaluation was a systematic                                classroom evaluation measuring the instructor’s way of teaching and behavior                                inside the classroom observed by the department chair. Furthermore, it also                                includes the student-instructor interaction and the learning environment. This                                classroom evaluation describes instructional practices of the instructors and                                 suggests improvement on classroom instruction and management based on                                feedback from the students and peer instructors.

Strategic Planning                                        CvSU is engaged in annual Strategic Planning activities. It is the                                University’s organizational management activity to assess prior operations, set                                priorities, focus energy and resources, strengthen operations, ensure that                                employees and other stakeholders are working towards common goals, establish                                agreement around intended outcomes, and assess and adjust the University’s                                 direction in response to a changing environment. This activity is well thought of,                                with substantial budget and is done with a long period of time outside the                                University vicinity. This Strategic Planning primarily directs to the operation of the                                whole University system.                            4.
