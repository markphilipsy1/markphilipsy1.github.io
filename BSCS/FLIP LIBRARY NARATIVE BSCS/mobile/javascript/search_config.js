Library Classification Scheme                                       Library classification schemes serve to arrange books and other library                               materials  in  a  logical  order  on  library  shelves  and  also  provide  order  for                               classified catalogs.                                       The LDML uses the Library of Congress Classification System or LCC                               (Table 3) for books and Dewey Decimal Classification or DDC (Table 4) for                               manuscripts.  The  LCC  system  groups  the  subject  using  the  letters  of  the                               alphabet and Arabic numerals, while the DDC groups the subjects using Arabic                               numerals only.                                       Combination  of  the  following  ways  of  classification  is  also  used:  1)                               classification by subject content; and 2) classification by physical form.

Collection Organization                                       The library ensures that the collection is organized for efficient retrieval.                               This  refers  to  the  process  of  cataloguing  and  classification  including  the                               preparation of all library materials. Cataloging and classification are used to                               develop an index of the library collection to enable users to determine if the                               library has the resources they need.

Descriptive cataloging consists of two elements: a) describing                                      the physical item of the material and; b) determining the main entry and                                      correct formatting of the entry and added entries suited for the material.                                              Anglo American Cataloging Rules edition 2 (AACR2) divides the                                      catalog record into eight areas as shown in  Table 5.

The first task facing the cataloger is to determine                                                    the choice of main entry. The general principle of                                                    main entry is to enter a work under the name/s of                                                    person(s)  or  corporate  body  responsible  for  its                                                    intellectual content. In the case of books, the chief                                                    source of information is the title page.                                              b.     The information is recorded exactly as it appears on                                                    the title page. Information appearing elsewhere in                                                    the  item  within  the  catalog  entry.  The  consistent                                                    spelling of the author entry used in the catalog (in                                                    current  practice,  editors  and  compilers  are  never                                                    given a main entry, although they were given one in                                                    the part) is ensured.                                  ≈ CvSU- Main Campus Library: Narrative Profile 2021 (BSCS) ≈                                                       Page 53 of 158","c.     In  current  practice,  authors  are  always  entered                                                    under the commonly known name (e.g., Mark Twain                                                    is under Twain, Mark rather than Clemens, Samuel                                                    Langhorne). The general rule for titles of nobility is                                                    to  employ  the  most  commonly  used  name.  An                                                    aristocrat  may be entered under his  or her family                                                    name or title (e.g., the Duke of Wellington is entered                                                    under his title rather than his family name) (Figure                                                    5).

Subject Cataloging                                              Subject cataloging is the process of assigning subject headings                                      and classification number to a reference material. It deals with what is                                      inside the book or library material with the purpose of listing under one                                      uniform word or phrase all the materials on a given topic that a library                                      has. Subject cataloging determines the subject or topic of the book. It                                      usually  assigns  one  or  more  subject  headings  from  a  specified                                      thesaurus, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings or Sears’                                      List of Subject Headings and the assignment of classification number                                      from the classification schedule such as LC or DDC.

A good number to select is                                                    5, as there is then room for both sides for additional                                                    interpolation  as  necessary.  For  example:  A  book                                                    already in the collection by Richard Taylor would be                                                    T21. A new book added to the same classification                                                    number  by  another  author  named  Taylor  would                                                    need a different author number. A book by Sidney                                                    Taylor could then be T215. This leaves room for the                                                    insertion of additional authors between Richard and                                                    Sydney – using T212, T213 and T214. (It is best to                                                    avoid using 1 and 9, if possible, since the use  of                                                    either  would  mean  going  to  a  fourth  figure  when                                                    another  author  has  to  be  inserted).  To                                                    accommodate a book by Harriet Taylor, it would be                                                    necessary to go to the previous number – which is                                                    T19. In this case, it is wise to add a digit such as                                 ≈ CvSU- Main Campus Library: Narrative Profile 2021 (BSCS) ≈                                                       Page 62 of 158","T195,  since  an  author  beginning  with  Tau  would                                                    cause a conflict.                                             d.     For  shelving  purposes,  Cutter  number  within  any                                                    given  class  should  be  considered  as  a  decimal                                                    arrangement. For example: T19, T195, T21, T212,                                                    etc. (Not T12, T21, T195, T212).                                              e.     A work mark is used to distinguish titles by the same                                                    author. This is a letter taken from the first key word                                                    in the title. Thus: A writer’s Notebook by Maugham                                                    would  be  designated  M44w;  and  Of  Human                                                    Bondage would be M44o. In the case of voluminous                                                    authors, the use of two letters for the work mark is                                                    advisable. Thus: Dickens’ David Copperfield would                                                    be D55da and Dombey and Son D55do. (Note: A                                                    lower case letter or letters is used for the work mark,                                                    rather  than  a  capital  letter.  It  is  imperative  that  a                                                    script l be used so that there will be no confusion                                                    with number 1). In case of books in series, by the                                                    same  author,  all  in  the  same  classification  and                                                    beginning  with  the  same  word  –  such  as                                                    Zaidenberg’s How to Draw ... --      it is advisable to                                                    use the key words for the work mark.                                                     For  example:  How  to  Draw  Cartoons  would  be                                                            Z1hc;  and  How  to  Draw  People  would  be                                                            Z1hp. (This method avoids excessively long                                                            work marks, such as h, ho, how, how).                                              f.     The  use  of  zero  is  avoided  because  it  is  easily                                                    confused with the letter O. That is why there are no                                                    zeros used in the table.                                              g.

Thus                                                    McElroy would be M15 and MacFarland would be                                                    M16.                                              h.     The Cutter Author Table is particularly well suited to                                                    fiction. Books by authors with similar surnames are                                                    more easily located on the shelf if there is a number                                                    on the spine.                                                     For example: Johnson would be J63 and Johnstone J65.                                              i.     Very  often  a  main  entry  is  under  title  (e.g.                                                    periodicals,    anonymous       works,    government                                                    publications, almanacs, encyclopedias, etc.). In this                                                    case the Cutter number is taken from the first word                                                    in the title (exclusive of articles).

However,  the  amount  of  damage  by  light                                                    depends upon the following factors.                                                            1)     Intensity  of  light-  as  the  intensity  of                                                                   light   increases     the     rate    of                                                                   deterioration  of  the  paper  also                                                                   increases.                                                            2)     Duration of exposure- the duration of                                                                   exposure  of  paper  to  light  is  directly                                                                   proportional to its deterioration.                                                            3)     Distance  from  the  source  of  light-                                                                   more the distance, less the damage.                                                    Heat                                                            Usually the source of heat is high atmospheric                                                    temperature.  Heat  is  measured  in  terms  temperature                                                    either in Centigrade scale or Fahrenheit scale. High heat                                                    with low humidity causes dehydration of cellulose fibers                                                    and the paper becomes brittle. It loses its flexibility to the                                                    extent that it tends to crumble on touch. On the other                                                    hand, high temperature with high humidity creates the                                                    condition for the growth of moulds. If electric bulbs are                                                    used  for  lighting  purpose,  they  increase  room                                                    temperature as high powerful bulbs generate more heat.                                                    Besides, extreme variation  in  temperature (say 50c in                                                    winter  and  450c  in  summer)  affects  the  physical                                                    condition of the library materials.                                                    Humidity and Moisture                                                            Humidity  is  the  amount  of  moisture  in  the                                                    atmospheric air. The moisture is measured in terms of                                                    relative humidity. All organic objects absorb water to a                                                    greater or lower extent and the water goes inside the                                                    object  through  surrounding  air.  Because  of  this                                                    absorbency property, the paper absorbs more moisture                                                    when there is high humidity. Certain amount of humidity                                                    is necessary for the flexibility of paper but in prolonged                                                    high  humid  condition,  paper  becomes  soggy  and  the                                                    moisture weakens the fibers of paper. Moisture  is the                                                    root  cause of various  types  of  physical,  chemical  and                                                    biological deterioration of  library materials. It  weakens                                                    the adhesive and makes the book binding loose.

Dust, which is highly dangerous for                                                    the library and archival collection, composed of soil, tar,                                                    metallic substances, fungus spores and moisture among                                                    other things. Since dust is air borne it settles down on                                                    any surface of the object. Dust is hygroscopic in nature                                                    and when it is mixed with high humidity, it is transformed                                                    into dirt and if this dirt sticks to the surface of the books,                                                    it becomes difficult to remove. Dust and dirt are sources                                                    of both physical and chemical degradation of the library                                                    collection. Dust acts as a nucleus around which moisture                                                    collects  and  this  moisture  provides  the  necessary                                                    humidity  for  the  growth  of  fungus  and  for  chemical                                                    reaction, which lead to the formation of acids. Since dust                                                    and dirt are solid particles of varying size and hardness                                                    they exert abrasion on the surface of the books.                                                     Water                                                            Water occurs in all the normal state of  matter-                                                    solid,  liquid  and  gas.

Librarians in charge of the documentary heritage are                                             directly  responsible  for  the  overall  conservation  and                                             preservation of their collections. But they are not always aware                                             how to handle, store and use collections carefully to minimize                                             damage  and  help  preservation.  The  standard  of  care  and                                             handling of books by their custodians and users is often pretty                                             low.  Improper  storage,  faulty  repairment,  rough  handling,                                             deliberate abuse, folding the fore-edges of pages as a mark of                                             reading,  marking  by  ballpen,  mutilation,  vandalism  are  all                                             examples of deterioration of books by human beings.                                       e.

In                                             libraries, archives and museums there is a likely-hood of                                             fire as the collections are mostly organic in nature. Once                                             fire starts, it is difficult to save those materials which get                                             fire. Items not directly engulfed in flames can be charred                                             by soot and smoke. Heat emitted from fire causes bindings                                             to  shrink  and  warp  and  plastic  base  materials  to  melt.                                             Water used for fighting fire can cause enormous damage.

These  will  lead  documents  to  absorb  water,  swell,  warp                                             and  become  extremely  vulnerable  to  physical  damage.                                             Dyes and ink may bleed and book pages stick together.                                             Leather  bindings  seriously  warp  and  change  shape.                                             Effects of disasters on library collections are too obvious to                                             comprehend.                         Section 3.

If essential notes, such as call numbers, need to be made                                             in a book, use a soft lead pencil.                                       l.     If pages of books and other items must be marked, use                                             acid-free paper strips. Do not fold the corners of pages or                                             use printed, colored adhesive paper, such as “post-it” self-                                             adhesive notes.                                       m.     13. Photocopying is one of the major causes of damage to                                             library books. Some materials are difficult to handle and                                             copy safely. Most importantly, do not press down on the                                             spine of books while photocopying and take extra care with                                             large and heavy books. There are some types of materials                                             which are so fragile they should not be photocopied at all.                                    ≈ CvSU- Main Campus Library: Narrative Profile 2021 (BSCS) ≈                                                       Page 70 of 158","n.     If you have to move items than cannot be held comfortably                                             in hand, use a trolley. Never overload a trolley, make two                                             trips.                                       o.     Unnecessary  metal  clips,  paper  fasteners,  pins  and                                             staples  should  be  removed;  rust  stains  and  holes  will                                             eventually result if these are left in place. Remove carefully                                             and, if necessary, replace with smooth, solid plastic paper                                             clips,  white  cotton  tape  ties  or  an  acid-  free  folder  or                                             pocket. Rubber bands should be removed and discarded                                             because  they  curl  and  tear  the  edges  of  paper  and  will                                             eventually age and break.                                       p.

Use  fillers  made  of  acid  free                                             materials.                                       q.     Generally books should be supported upright on the shelf                                             by other books or bookends. Books left leaning on shelves                                             can cause the book to become distorted and the binding                                             may  break.  Large  books  such  as  elephant  folios  and                                             broadsheets should be stored flat on the shelf otherwise                                             the weight of the pages can damage the binding, but do                                             not stack them too high or they will be difficult to remove.                                       r.     Do not overcrowd the shelves. Books should slide easily                                             onto  shelves  without  force.  Make  space  if  they  do  not.                                             Shelves  should  be  deep  enough  to  fully  support  the                                             volume and leave a space between the books and the back                                             of the shelf to allow air circulation.                                       s.     Make sure materials in compact units are not protruding or                                             likely to fall on the ground, because it will be crushed.                                       t.     A  book  should  be  removed  from  the  shelf  by  grasping                                             firmly the center of the spine. Never remove books from                                             the shelves by pulling at the top of the spine, this is the                                             most vulnerable part of the spine, and can tear or break                                             easily.                                       u.     Pamphlets  can  easily  be  lost  or  damaged  on  shelves                                             because they are so small. If placed straight on the shelf                                             or in a half-filled upright pamphlet box, they can become                                             slouched,  squashed  and  crushed.  Individual  pamphlets                                             can  be  stored  in  see-through  polypropylene  folders  and                                             groups  of  pamphlets  and  serial  issues  in  grey                                             polypropylene serial boxes.                                       v.

Large sheet material should be stored flat in shallow plan                                             cabinet drawers. Drawers should not be overfilled because                                             this will make retrieval difficult and sheets can  easily be                                             damaged as the drawers are opened and closed. Do not                                             fold  any  item;  it  will  eventually  break  along  the  fold.  If                                             material is too large to fit in drawers, it can be placed in a                                             folder in an adequately sized storage space or on storage                                             rolls made for it.                                       y.

Section 4. Disaster Preparedness                                              Disasters  are  generally  unexpected  events  with  destructive                                      consequences to a collection. Therefore it is vital for any library to take                                      every possible precaution to prevent the occurrence of an unavoidable                                      disaster.  A  disaster  planning  is  an  essential  element  of  preventive                                      conservation. It is also necessary to identify any external and internal                                      threats that might cause problems for the collection and measures to                                      meet those threats. Without an existing disaster preparedness plan or                                      crisis management plan, the librarians will be unable to act quickly to                                      organize  salvage efforts.  It  should  be mandatory  for  every  library  to                                      have  a  written  disaster  preparedness  and  response  plan  containing                                      description of emergency procedures, emergency supplies list, disaster                                      response outline, conservation experts, list of staff volunteers, list of                                      external contacts and names, addresses, home and work telephone                                      numbers  of  personnel  with  emergency  responsibilities.  Besides,                                      libraries should be provided with fire and smoke detection system and                                      automatic fire extinguishing system. Use of match stick or open flame                                      and  smoking  should  strictly  prohibit  inside  the  library.  Inflammable                                      materials and chemicals should not be stored inside the stacks. The                                      telephone  number  of  the  fire  office  should  be  visibly  and  clearly                                      exhibited. Location of emergency gate must be clearly indicated. The                                      electrical defects and faults should be set right in time.                         Section 5.

Article 5. Weeding of Library Materials                                       Weeding is the process wherein books and other library materials that                               are no longer needed are taken out of the collection. This is done to keep the                               collection updated and responsive to the needs and interest of the users. This                               may result  in discarding of materials. (Example:  return to  the supply office,                               donating to other libraries, etc.)                                       Evaluation  of  library  collection  is  done  in  order  to  determine  if  the                               materials the library has are still suitable to the needs of its users.

Weeding is                               necessary to make space for current materials, to make the collection more                               attractive, to facilitate ease of use of the collections by patrons and staff, and                               to reduce damage to books caused by overcrowding and space limitations.

Collection Analysis and Evaluation                         Section 1. Introduction                                              Collection Analysis is the systematic evaluation of the quality of                                      a library collection to determine the extent to which it meets the library’s                                      service goals and objectives and the information needs of its clientele.                                              The purpose of collection analysis and evaluation is to                                      determine the quality of the collection. It falls into two parts: first,                                      one must evaluate the collection itself in terms of numbers,                                      quality, currency, and the like. Second, the collection should be                                      judged on how well it serves the needs of the community.                         Section 2.

A periodical index works like a                                             subject catalog for the articles within a group of magazines                                             and journals. The process of using an index is similar to                                             the process of doing subject or keyword searches for items                                             in a library catalog.

Technical Services                                       These are non-visible processes or activities that are performed by the                               librarian/s  and  library  staff.  Every  material  added  to  the  library  collection  is                               processed in the Technical Services Section before it is brought to the proper                               section for circulation.                         Section 1. Selection                                              Selection is the process of deciding which materials should be                                      added to a library collection. Selection of new materials is a continuous                                      process  requiring  evaluation  of  both  the  current  collection  and  the                                      materials  being  considered  for acquisition.  Lists  of  available  titles  of                                      books and serials from brochures/catalog given by dealers are sent to                                      the  deans  of  the  different  colleges  for  recommendation.  List  of                                      recommended books is forwarded to the dealers so that the books will                                      be  delivered  for  examination.  List  of  recommended  serial  titles  is                                      subscribed as budget permits. Requesting parties are notified of the                                      delivery of requested materials in the Technical Services Section of the                                      library. Notice on the allotted period for the examination of the items to                                      be considered for acquisition is also given.                         Section 2. Acquisition                                              Acquisition is the process of selecting, ordering, and receiving                                      materials for library collections by purchase, exchange, or gift, which                                      may include budgeting and negotiating with outside agencies, such as                                      publishers, dealers, and vendors, to obtain resources to meet the needs                                      of  the  institution’s  clientele,  in  the  most  economical  and  expeditious                                      manner.                                   ≈ CvSU- Main Campus Library: Narrative Profile 2021 (BSCS) ≈                                                       Page 92 of 158","Acquisition through purchase, donation, gift or exchange of the                                      items  that  the  selection  personnel  have  identified  as  a  desirable                                      addition to the collection is systematically implemented. The acquisition                                      process starts by providing respective colleges the list of books and                                      serials  (journals,  magazines,  etc.)  for  purchase/  subscription.

Material Processing                                              Material processing of the newly acquired books is unpacked                                      and  inspected  for  imperfections.  Defective  items  are  returned  for                                      replacement.  Finally,  acceptable  books  are  stamped  with  mark                                      ownership on the designated part/portion of the book.                                              A  set  of  policies  on  library  collection  development  is  being                                      implemented in the University to assist the library in the selection and                                      acquisition of relevant resources.

After                                             these have been catalogued (descriptive cataloging), arrange                                             them alphabetically according to their access point.                         Section 5. Cataloging                                              Cataloging is the process of making a bibliographic record about                                      published works, particularly books. Bibliographic records are designed                                      to facilitate easy retrieval and to support administrative activities such                                      as acquisitions, circulation, preservation and management of collection                                      (Figure 4). Cataloging is divided into two parts namely:                                       a.     Descriptive  Cataloging.  It  is  a  part  of  the  cataloging                                             process wherein the cataloger transfers certain technical                                             data about an item into a record according to rules. Simply                                             stated, it is describing an item bibliographically based on                                             standard rules as stated in AACR2 or the Anglo-American                                             Cataloging Rules 2.                                       b.     Subject Cataloging. It is a part of the cataloging process                                             wherein  the  cataloger  assigns  appropriate  subject                                             headings  for  the  item  selected  from  the  standard  list                                             subject  headings,  e.g.  Sear’s  List  of  Headings  and  the                                             Library of Congress Subject Headings. Catalog entries are                                             then checked against authority file for possible duplication.                         Section 6. Classification                                              Classification  is  the  process  of  dividing  library  materials  into                                      logically hierarchical classes, subclasses, and sub-subclasses based                                      on the characteristics they have in common and those that distinguish                                      them. Classification by arranging library materials according to subject                                      content, physical form, date and place of publication, is conducted to                                      locate  books and  other  library  materials  in  a  logical  order  on  library                                      shelves.  Encoding  of  catalog  entries  into  the  database  is  done;  bar                                      codes are printed on newly processed book and subject bibliographies                                      are prepared (Figure 4).                                         ≈ CvSU- Main Campus Library: Narrative Profile 2021 (BSCS) ≈                                                       Page 94 of 158","Acquisition                                          Receiving and physical processing                                        (Collating, stamping, accessioning)                                           Checking the Library database and                                       authority file for possible duplication                       Duplicate record                                     No duplicate record found                        found                                                                  Search other databases (LC, OCLC,                                                              OhioLink, iLib, etc) using the Internet for                                                                    available bibliographic record                                                    No bibliographic record             Bibliographic record and                                                   and classification                classification number                                                     number found                             found                                                        Create original                  Import data into the                                                   cataloging record                    library database                                                                                        Edit/ Enhance record                                            Encode bibliographic record to             and call number as                                             the Cataloging module of the                   necessary                                                    Library System                      Add accession                                                   Finish processing (adding                    number to the                                                     spine label barcoding,                    shelf list and                                                    pasting book pockets,                  existing record in                                                inserting book cards, etc.)                      the library                       database                                                                                            Circulation                               Figure 4.
