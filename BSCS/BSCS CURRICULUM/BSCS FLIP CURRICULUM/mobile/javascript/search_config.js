Several transformations                 in the name of the school took place; Indang Farm School in 1918, Indang Rural High School in                 1927, and Don Severino National Agriculture School in 1958. In 1964, the school was converted                  into  a  State  College  by  virtue  of  Republic  Act  3917  and  became  known  as  Don  Severino                 Agricultural College (DSAC). On January 22, 1998, by virtue of Republic Act No.8468, DSAC was                 converted into Cavite State University.                         The College of Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT) started as the Department                 of Agricultural Engineering inv1976. It offered basic agricultural engineering courses required by                  the BSA curriculum. In 1985, the unit was renamed to Department of Engineering and Agro-                 Industrial Technology (DEAIT). By virtue of Board Resolution No. 5, S1985, it started to offer                 Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering on the first semester of SY 1985 – 1986.                         In 1992, the department was elevated to the School status. This resulted in the creation                 of  two  (2)  distinct  departments:  the  Engineering  Science  Department  and  the  Agricultural                 Engineering Department. The formation of these departments delineated the basic engineering                 science  courses  from  the  agricultural  engineering  courses.  In  1993,  the  Department  of                  Engineering Technology was created. The newly created department offers non-degree courses                 in engineering technology.                         In 1998, when the College was elevated to University status, the School of Engineering                 (SEng)  was  subsequently  elevated  to  the  College  level  and  was  named  as  the  College  of                 Engineering (CEng). To accommodate IT courses offerings; the College was renamed as the                  College of Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT) in 2001.                         Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), was first offered on the first semester                 of SY 1995-1996, to keep abreast with the technological demands of the industries within the                 province and the entire country per se, and the rapidly changing technology. The program is also                      BS COMPUTER SCIENCE                                                                                       LEVEL III – PHASE II","3   Instruction                   considered as a priority course by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) as per CMO no.                 5, series of 2019.  It is currently offered under the Department of Information Technology (DIT) of                 the College of Engineering and Information Technology (CEIT).                         In  February  2021,  CHED  granted  the  university  Certificate  of  Program  Compliance                  (COPC) for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science which means that the university is fully                 compliant with the policies, standards and guidelines of the institution in terms of the program                 offering.                         The  BSCS  program  prepares  students  to  design  and  create  algorithmically  complex                 software and develop new and effective algorithms for solving computing problems. The program                  also  includes  the  study  of  the  standards  and  practices  in  Software  Engineering.  It  prepares                 students to acquire skills and disciplines required for designing, writing, and modifying software                 components, modules, and applications that comprise software solutions.

Require  BS  Computer  Science  students  to  complete  thesis  as  their                           terminal project requirement                                    A thesis is a technical report on a systematic investigation of a problem that                            can be solved using computing. It may include a solution, an approximate or partial                            solution, a scientific investigation, or the development of results leading to the solution                            of the problem. A Computer Science thesis must be anchored on Computer Science                            principles.                                   BSCS students are required to complete a thesis that is focused on the theories                             and concepts of computing in the form of a scientific work. A terminal project such as                            thesis would not only demonstrate their comprehensive knowledge of the area of study                      BS COMPUTER SCIENCE                                                                                       LEVEL III – PHASE II","32   Instruction                              and research methods used, but also allow them to apply the concepts and methods                            to a specific problem in their area of specialization.                                   BSCS  students  have  conducted  their  research  studies  as  part  of  their                            academic requirement. In the old curriculum, there are three (3) thesis courses being                             offered,  namely,  Undergraduate  Thesis  I,  which  involves  the  title  proposal  and                            approval and capsule defense and approval, Undergraduate Thesis II, which involves                            thesis outline defense and approval, and Undergraduate Thesis III, which involves the                            final  manuscript  defense  and  submission.  Listed  down  below  in  Table  4  are  the                            research studies conducted by BSCS students from 2016 up to 2020.                              Table 4.

The additional nine (9) units are                         additional  math  requirements  which  are  deemed  necessary  for  identified  professional                         courses and electives. The remaining six (6) units include one (1) professional course and                          one (1) institutionally mandated course, which is Gender and Development.

The  CMO                         regarding GE subjects, however, did not include Filipino subjects.

Assignments are given to the class to enhance the knowledge of                         students on topics being discussed in class.  It could also be a preparation of the next                          topic which will discussed on the next meeting.                                Brainstorming. Brainstorming is a group creativity by which efforts are made to                         find  a  conclusion  for  a  specific  problem  by  gathering  a  list  of  ideas  spontaneously                         contributed by its members.  This helps to get students unstuck by jolting them out of their                         normal ways of thinking.  Therefore, during brainstorming sessions, students should avoid                       BS COMPUTER SCIENCE                                                   LEVEL III – PHASE II","77   Instruction                           criticizing or rewarding ideas.  Mind mapping is a great way to brainstorm, make a plan,                         or turn ideas into steps needed to make it real.                                Field Trips/Visits. In most cases, exposure to real life situations are important                         learning methodologies where concepts are applied in site.  Field visits help students                          acquire  methodologies  and  technologies  relevant  to  their  field.    During  these  visits,                         students are given opportunity to observe how the principles are put into practice.  This                         enhances the students’ knowledge that they have learned in the classroom.                                Group Discussion/Interactive Learning. In this strategy, a topic is presented                         through presentation, after which the group assigned an issue to discuss, brainstorm and                          interact.    Through  the  internet,  members  of  the  group  may  conduct  a  more  thorough                         research about the topic to enhance their knowledge.  Moreover, a set of questions are                         given to each group to serve as guide for the discussion and presentation.  At the end of                         the session, in front of the whole class, each group presents answers to the questions                         posted by the lecturer and their synthesis of the topic.  The lecturer then clarifies and                         stresses important points and summarizes the main features or arguments of the topics.                         Each group evaluates the presentation of the other groups using a class-evaluated rubric                          assessment.                                Group  Discussion  with  Individual  Reflection.  When  students  continuously                         reflect on their experiences, students find their ideas gaining in complexity and power and                         they develop increasingly strong abilities to integrate new information.  Students in the                         class are grouped and are presented with a topic, and the guide questions are discussed                          by  the  members  of  the group.  The  leader  facilitates  the  discussion  while  the  reporter                         records the main points arrived by the members of the group.  Each student prepares                         his/her own reflection of the topics presented and submits it to the lecturer.  Then, a short                         presentation of the main points of the group is presented by the designated reporter.  The                        BS COMPUTER SCIENCE                                                   LEVEL III – PHASE II","78   Instruction                           lecturer guides the reporters by extracting answers to the questions. The reflection papers                         are then graded using a class-evaluated rubric assessment.                                Reporting.  In  some  subjects,  students  are  given  the  responsibility  to  present                         specific  topics  in  the  class.    Students  are  rated  both  by  their  professors  and  also                          classmates.  Each student gives rating to the reporter based on the following criteria:                         content,  organization  (vocabulary,  use  of  complete  sentences,  comprehension),  and                         delivery (preparedness, use of props, time limit, posture and eye contact, speaks with                         clarity, enthusiasm).                                Laboratory  Exercises/Experiments.  Laboratory  exercises  are  parts  of  the                          requirements  for  passing  the  course.    This  includes  activities  or  experiments  which                         enhance the understanding and knowledge level of students on topics discussed in the                         lecture.  Students are exposed to hands-on activities which provide them the opportunity                         to go through the procedures and processes.  The laboratory serves as an active learning                         environment for students where practical experiments may lead to good understanding of                         underlying theories and desired skills in the conduct of the experiments.

Table 9 shows the number of enrollees from from AY 2016-2017 to AY                                2020-2021. In AY 2016-2017, there was a decline in the number of enrollees as a                                result  of  the  implementation  of  the  K-12  program  of  Department  of  Education                                 (DepEd). In the following academic year, 2017 – 2018, the lowest enrollees were                                observed due to the fact that there were now two (2) successive year levels with                                only few first year enrollees.                                       There was a significant increase in the enrollees on the first semester of                                AY 2018-2019 because of the K+12 graduates who were admitted in the program.                                Since then, there was an increase in the enrollment up to present. The retention                                rate in the program for the past five (5) academic years is 92.19%.

Table 10 shows the total number of graduates for the last five years, the                                corresponding respondents and the percentage of per year. The data from the                                table revealed that year 2019 (70 graduates) has the greatest number of graduates                                followed by year 2020 (15 graduates). The year with the least graduates’ number                                was in 2018 (31 graduates).  The results also showed that the large number of                                 respondents were in the year 2018 with 83.87% while the years with least number                                of respondents is in 2020 with 86.67% or 13 graduate respond6ents (which most                                of them haven’t responded yet). In general, the results of tracer revealed that the                                old graduates of BSCS were difficult to trace (per half, they have change their                                contact details).

Employment status and work performance of BSCS graduates                                        The employability of graduates was characterized into three major aspects                                of employment. These are the nature of employment (or the type of employer as                                shown  in  Table  12),  the  status  of  employment  as  shown  in  Table  13  (or  the                                respondents’ tenure of employment) and lastly, the employment positions in their                                 current  employment  environment  (as  shown  in  Table  14).  The  nature  of                                employment in this study was categorized into three, namely: government, non-                                government  organization,  private,  and  unemployed.  In  the  employment  status                                there were also three: contractual, regular or permanent, others (temporary, job                                order) and unemployed. In employment position, the categories were managerial,                                 rank and file, and others.                                       Table 12 shows the distribution of employment positions of graduates to                                managerial, supervisory, and rank and file from different nature of employment and                                status. The result shows that majority of the graduate respondents (76.61%) were                                employed as rank and file at different nature of employment and status. Based on                                the  results,  it  was  also  found  that  only  8.06%  of  the  respondents  were  in                                managerial  position  and  16.13%  are  in  the  others  (supervisory  position).
