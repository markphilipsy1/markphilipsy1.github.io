Professional  courses  begin  in  the  first  year  and  threads                        through the development of competencies up to the fourth year level. The BSN                        program provides an intensive nursing practicum that will refine clinical skills from                        the first year level to ensure basic clinical competencies required of a beginning                        nurse practitioner.                           Objective: The BSN program aims to produce a fully functioning nurse who is able                        to perform the competencies under each of the Key Areas of Responsibility as                        enumerated in Article IV Section 5 herein, of the CMO 14 s. 2009.

Their  qualifications  may  reflect  the  value  of  their  products  such  as  students,                        research,  and  extension  activities.  Then,  the  faculty  should  be  composed  of                        competent  members  in  terms  of  academic  qualifications,  experience  and                        professional expertise. In addition, they should manifest desired personal qualities                        and high levels of professionalism.                                 To  be  effective,  faculty  members  should  be  properly  compensated  and                        taken care of. Opportunities for continuous personal and professional development                        must  be  available  to  them.  Also,  a  policy  of  fair  and  equitable  distribution  of                        teaching assignments and workload should be adopted by the institution.                                Cavite State University has a well-funded Faculty Development Program. It                        aims  to  improve  the  attitude,  skills  and  knowledge  of  the  individual  faculty                        members. The program includes criteria for the selection of scholars/grantees, and                        opportunities/study  privileges,  research  grants,  training,  are  available.  Faculty                        members  are  encouraged  to  join  relevant  professional  organizations  and  to                        continuously upgrade their knowledge and skills.

Faculty  members  at  Cavite  State  University  are  encouraged  to  pursue                        graduate  studies  through  various  forms  of  scholarships  and  attendance  to                        trainings, seminars and conferences.                          3.1. WELL DEFINED OBJECTIVES                           There are nine major development areas for faculty development based on the                        Development Plan of HRMO.

The faculty is being                               evaluated by the students, and superior according to their (a) Commitment                               (b) Knowledge of the subject matter, (c) Teaching for independent learning,                               and (d) Management of learning.

At least 30 students were requested to participate in the                               SET which were randomly selected by the designated evaluators.                                    The  result  and  summary  of  the  SET  will  then  be  tabulated  after  the                               evaluation and will be presented to the Dean of the college. The Dean will                               counter check the results and will schedule one on one huddles with the                               faculty members to inform them of the result of the SET-in order to improve                               their craft or if the evaluation says otherwise.
