INTRODUCTION                         The  advancement  of  ideas  and  practical  concepts  for  changing  how  doctors  and                patients  administer  treatment  and treat  symptoms  is  what  Nursing  Science  is  all  about. It                 integrates basic, applied, and human research through a multi-faceted prism that investigates                innovative and improved approaches to provide health care. Service, on the other hand, is one                 of  Cavite  State  University's  three  (3)  tenets  (CvSU).  Delivering  extension  services  and                resources through health, medical, and nursing knowledge and skills to the population would                increase their level of living by encouraging them to handle life challenges more objectively                 and see health knowledge and skills as a solution that will enhance their quality of life.

SYSTEMS INPUTS AND PROCESSES                         The mission statement acts as a blueprint for how an organization can accomplish its                 intent and identity, core values, and reason for being. The vision statement depicts the larger                future of what an organization wants to achieve, while the mission statement serves as a                 roadmap for how an organization can achieve its role and identity, core values, and reason for                being. There are important statements about both the organization and the people who run it.                Goals, on the other hand, are specific statements made by an organization in order to achieve                 its objectives within a specific timeline. An objective is a landmark in the process of putting a                plan into action.                        The VMGO sets the foundations for the university to become what it needs to be in the                 future. It numbers the vital system inputs and the best processes for achieving its objectives.                The priorities define the fields in which the initiative should spend, such as staff, infrastructure,                and equipment upgrades. The college faculty member’s expertise in allied health fields like in                 nursing, medical technology, and midwifery, as well as an adequate budget to start and sustain                the planned program of operations, are vital inputs. The activities are guided by approved RD                 \&  E  agendas  and  institutional  policies.  Most  of  the  extension  programs  and  activities  are                seminars and trainings are conducted by faculty and staff of the department, participation in                fairs and exhibits, production and distribution of learning materials, advocacy promotion and                 establishment of linkages with different government and private institutions.                        Family/households, health workers, teachers, out-of-school youngsters, traders, local                 business players, barangay and youth leaders, and disadvantaged segments of the society                are the intended beneficiaries of the programs. As the college extends its services to the                nearby communities, community needs assessments are conducted to response appropriately                 to  the  felt  needs  of  the  residents      Planning  for  community  programs  and  activities  are                dependent  on  the  urgency,  prioritized  problems  which  is  needed  to  be  addressed,  and                according to the availability of community resources and resources which can be sourced out                 from funding agencies or from the university. During program implementations, the Extension                Office maximizes the available human and materials resources from the college, the university                and the partner community or agency.                          The extension services are evaluated on the basis of its accomplishment, by directly                comparing the activity target set or performance indicators with the actual output  indicators                 set per activity  One of the primary goals of the extension program is to increase the knowledge                of the partner community residents and stakeholders’ increased level of knowledge and create                beneficial  changes  in  behaviors  after  receiving  and  participating  with  the  program                 implementation such as dissemination of health promotion information, prevention of diseases                and management of illnesses, upgrading health practices and adopting safe and effective                treatment  coupled with humanly caring and  competent application of nursing skills to the                 intended beneficiaries . Following the acquisition of knowledge, actual application and                                                                          Bachelor of Science in Nursing                                                                                        Level III – Phase 2","EXTENSION AND COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT    4                  harnessing of the learned skills and knowledge, utilization of those knowledge and knowledge                 transfer are also established.                        The increased interest of participants in health and health care related activities would                 be  one  of  its  positive  markers.  Finally,  the  overall  effect  of  the  implemented  extension                programs  on  the target clienteles  would  be their  improved  health  status,  increased health                awareness and improved practices as a result of their exposure to the department's programs,                 services and activities. It is also predicted that the number of people involved in health and                health activities will even increase in the years to come. The success at each stage will be                tracked and analyzed in order to gauge and fine-tune the protocols of each activity in order to                 meet the program's goals.

Thus, CvSU envisions to help                 alleviate  the  standard  of  living  of  the  economically  and  socially  disadvantaged  sectors  of                society through its extension programs. This results to the involvement of the university in the                improvement  of  life  of  farmers,  families,  women,  children,  out-of-school  youths,  local                 government  employees  and  other  clients  through  the  conduct  of  relevant  education  and                training;  farm  and  business  advisory  services;  demonstration  services;  and  information,                communication and technology services.                          In In this, CvSU formulates a unified Research and Extension Agenda and Programs                 (RDEAP) which serves as a guide for the whole institution when conducting research and                extension. To cope up with technological changes in society, the Office of the Vice President                for Research and Extension (OVPRE) conducted a workshop to craft the CvSU Research and                 Extension Agenda last June 14 – 15, 2017 at the Hostel Tropicana. It was then approved by                the BOR comprising of the following thematic areas:                           Agri-fisheries and Food Security.

Community                organizing serves as an integral tool in community development that follows a systematic and                cyclical process that facilitates education of the people with capability enhancement activities.                 It  nurtures  the  ability  of  the  society  to  organize  themselves  and  to  emphasize  people                involvement in the resolution of issues and concerns in the community.                       The College of Nursing is in a strategic position to continue serving the Filipino people                 and provides the avenue of exploring innovative ideas and practices in education, research                and extension.

Generally, the program aimed to provide extension activities to advance community people’s                 life regarding health and wellness and promote community enhancement. Specifically, it aimed                to:                1. Help identify the health problems and needs of the community and describe the health care                 delivery system through SWOT analysis, community needs assessment and diagnosis.                2.

Provide technical health seminars/trainings to target clienteles and partners.                      The Training of Mothers on Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses was initially                delivered  in  March  2019.  Subsequent  seminar  was  planned  to  be  implemented  per                 sector/purok  in  the  community  to  reach  the  targeted  clients,  but  then  again  with  the  Taal                eruption of 2020 and then the Pandemic hit the locality.

To more or less 1,000 evacuees in the Evacuation Centers.                  “BEST PRACTICES” ADOPTED                 1.  Project Ugnayan: Barangay-Based Extension Project                        Ugnayan  is  a  Tagalog  word  which  connotes  linkages  and  coordination  among  the                stakeholders.  The University selected an UGNAYAN barangay or village where the extension                 services of the different colleges are focused.                        UGNAYAN  is  a  unified  extension  and  research  program  for  the  academic  units  of                 Cavite  State  University.  Originally,  its  philosophy  stated  that  “it  is  an  approach  to  rural                development where the spirit of coordination among those concerned in the upliftment of a                 community  is  given  importance.  From  a  singly  focused  agricultural  extension  project,  the                project evolved into a unified extension and research program.                         Partnerships to Local Government Unit will strengthen organizational relationships and                will increase productivity through sharing of knowledge, technology, skills, resources and other                relevant inputs in the conduct of extension activities. Matured technologies responsive to the                 needs of the communities will be utilized to provide more opportunities.                        Unity, teamwork, and efforts among the faculty, students, and target beneficiaries are                 key  elements  towards  the  success  of  any  extension  endeavor.  Also,  cooperation  among                experts  in  a  specific  discipline  will  help  enhance  projects  and  is  significant  towards  the                development of more comprehensive and effective projects all for poverty alleviation.                         This approach allows each major academic unit of the University to pursue community                service projects and applied research in a beneficiary barangay that is adopted as pilot area                 by the University.                 2.  Unified Research and Extension Agenda and Programs (RDEAP)                         CvSU  formulates  a  unified  RDEAP  in  congruence  with  local,  regional  and  national                 agencies. This  RDEAP  serves  as  guide for the  whole  university  system  when  conducting                research and extension activities. In relation, the College formulates the extension programs,                activities, and strategies based on this RDEAP. Also, local government units, stakeholders,                 beneficiaries, faculty extensionists, and students are consulted during the formulation of the                extension programs.

Continuous Involvement of Students in the Extension Program                         The College involves its students in the conduct of extension activities from the conduct                of  CNA  up  to  the  conduct  of  impact  assessment  study.  Involving  students  in  extension                 activities exposes them to real world learning experiences. Students are given opportunities                to  teach  and  train  the  beneficiaries  which  in  return  boosts  their  confidence  and  sense  of                 responsibility. Their part in the activities helps them to work as a team and somehow trains                them  to  be  leaders  inculcating  the  importance  of  bringing  their  own  future  projects  and                innovations intended to help the community.                          In  addition,  students  will  not  only  be  ready  for  their  future  careers  on  how  to  be                innovative but will learn to serve their fellowmen and the community. Nowadays, young people                 have lost the sense of helping others as well as good morals. This extension program will help                remedy this by guiding students thru and gear them up to be a good role model and influence                others.
