                                     Employees  who  rendered  valuable  contributions  to  the  institutions  are

                              members achieving work goals or doing the job well. When an incentive was given


                              for the  achievement,  a faculty  morale  is  increased  and  provides  inspiration for

                              others to excel. Rewarding incentive increases productivity and loyalty among the

                              forces of the academe and at the same time increases the status of the University

                              in the academic sector.

                                     CvSU grants awards and incentives to its employees who demonstrated


                              exemplary  service  and commendable  conduct  such  as  clearly  stipulated  in  the

                              CvSU Manual of Operations.

                                     In granting awards and incentives to faculty, the award selection committee

                              considers  the  following:  the  years  of  service  of  service  and  the  quality  and

                              consistency of performance, the obscurity of the positions, the salary level, the

                              unique  and  exemplary  quality  of  a  certain  achievement,  and  the  risks  and

                              temptations inherent in the work. Rewards and incentives are awarded in either


                              monetary  and  non-monetary  forms  to  faculty  members  who  demonstrated

                              exemplary  or  commendable  performances  as  stated  in  the  CvSU  Manual  of

                              person  a  penalty  in  any  amount  not  to  exceed  twenty-five  thousand  pesos

                              (P25,000). If another sanction hereunder or under any other law is heavier, the

                              1.3.2.  The Unified Workload System


                                     Based on the CMO No. 46, Series of 2012, the University is implementing

                              a  Unified  Workload  System  that  adheres  to  promote  the  core  functions  of  the

                              University namely: Instruction, Research, Extension and Production. Prior to the


                              Unified Workload System, the University has been providing incentives to faculty

                              members who are tasked to perform lateral assignments on top of their regular 18

                              teaching units. Using the Unified Workload System, the contribution of the faculty

                              to research and extension are now included in the criteria. The individual workload

                              performance  is  evaluated  based  on  the  academic  rank  and/or  designation,


                              teaching effectiveness, research performance/output and extension outcomes.

                                     The  Unified  Workload  System  is  intended  to  achieve  the  following

                              objectives:

                                         1.  to  reconcile  Individual  Performance  Commitment  and  Review

                                            (IPCR) of the faculty member and workload system;

                                         2.  to  help  the  University  in  delivering  effective  instruction  and

                                            improving the research and extension output;


                                         3.  to provide additional compensation to faculty members with extra

                                            teaching  loads,  research  and  extension  loads,  and  lateral

                                            assignments; and

                                         4.  to motivate faculty members in the performance of their assigned

                                            tasks.

                          3.2. Faculty Evaluation Procedure


                                     In addition, the department itself administers the “Student Evaluation for

                              Teachers  (SET)”  every  semester.  The  SET  is  done  to  indicate  the  teacher’s

                              performance  in  instruction  rated  by  the  students.  Thus,  it  also  indicates  how


                              satisfactory or excellent the teacher to the students. Likewise, SET also sets as

                              the basis for the instructors’ rank for rehiring.

                                     Aside from the evaluation rated by the students, the department chair also

                              conducts  class  observation/visitation.  The  said  evaluation  was  a  systematic

                              classroom  evaluation  measuring  the  instructor’s  way  of  teaching  and  behavior


                              inside  the  classroom  observed  by  the  department  chair.  Furthermore,  it  also

                              includes  the  student-instructor  interaction  and  the  learning  environment.  This

                              classroom  evaluation  describes  instructional  practices  of  the  instructors  and

                              suggests  improvement  on  classroom  instruction  and  management  based  on

                              feedback from the students and peer instructors.

                              Calendar is then communicated to all colleges, branch and satellite campuses to

                              synchronize all academic activities of the system.

                                     CvSU  is  engaged  in  annual  Strategic  Planning  activities.  It  is  the

                              University’s  organizational  management  activity  to  assess  prior  operations,  set

                              priorities,  focus  energy  and  resources,  strengthen  operations,  ensure  that


                              employees and other stakeholders are working towards common goals, establish

                              agreement  around  intended  outcomes,  and  assess  and  adjust  the  University’s

                              direction in response to a changing environment. This activity is well thought of,

                              with substantial budget and is done with a long period of time outside the University

                              vicinity.  This  Strategic  Planning  primarily  directs  to  the  operation  of  the  whole
